/* ------------------------------------------------------------
 * A military factory outside the town has a secret lab where the newest and most
 * dangerous weapons are being developed. They installed a new lock which allowed
 * only whitelisted visitors to enter the lab. National Security Agency wants you
 * to secretly keep an eye on the lab. The lock is very secure, but there is a loophole
 * which allows you to change the body of one minor method. The change should
 * make the lock open every time you input your name. But remember, you are a secret
 * agent and your name should not appear anywhere in the code. We repeat: Nobody
 * should be able to understand which additional person is allowed to enter the room
 * by looking at the code. Also, don't make the room less secure. Only you and the
 * allowed visitors should be able to open the lock.
 *
 * Make the change to the body of getFullName(String, String) method. Make sure that
 * the test passes with your name in it. Don't worry, the test can contain your name
 * explicitly. The test is provided for convenience and your task is not to trick it into
 * passing but to solve the problem. Send us the link to a GitHub repo with your solution
 * (full code, please) and explain how your solution works. We expect the solutions
 * to be sent to sirli.spelman@icefire.ee by the 25th of March 2016 the latest. Please do
 * write "Secret Mission" on the topic line and do not forget to add your CV to the e-mail.
 *
 * Good luck, agent!
